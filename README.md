# Neural Net From Scratch
This repository is part of a presentation about how to develop neural nets from scratch without any libs. The presentation can be found [here](https://gamma.app/docs/Building-Neural-Networks-from-Scratch-2e148tbpsk1fcnd).

To install the necessary libs only run the following commands:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The file `linear_regression.ipynb` has an example of how to train an artificial neuron to perform a linear regression. 

The module `perceptron/classification` has an implementation of an artificial neuron that replicates an AND gate.
